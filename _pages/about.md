Hey there ðŸ‘‹ My name is Xinghong Fu, but I usually go by Shin. I study Math and Computer Science at MIT.

I enjoy working with anything I don't understand. Right now, this happens to be nearly all of machine learning. 

Generative modelling is the main area of my interest now, with image, video and sequence generation being some modes I am interested in. Here is a quote to succintly summarize why I believe generative modelling is the key to the next breakthroughs in AI:

"What I cannot create, I cannot understand" - Richard Feynman

In a past life, I dabbled in some physics competitions, which was a catalyst for me to eventually explore scientific research.
