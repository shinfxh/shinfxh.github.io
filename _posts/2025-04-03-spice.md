I honestly think my spice tolerance is kinda low these days, but there's some screw loose in me that really enjoys sweating through my tongues. I usually regret it the next morning in the bathroom but proceed to repeat it again in the near future. 

This is also pretty much similarly true for running: hate it after one race and signing up for the next. Maybe I am a masochist. 

1. Double McSpicy 
2. Monster Curry Level 5
3. Mala hotpot (depends on where you get it)
4. Frozen tteokbokki
5. Buldak noodles
